Bar Talk is an album by jazz musician John Scofield .
John Scofield ( electric guitar ) ; Steve Swallow ( bass ) ; Adam Nussbaum ( drums ) .
This album was released on the Japanese subsidiary record label Novus , it was never released in the United States .
Once in the States , he paired up with Renée Roca with the intention of skating professionally with her .
When the International Skating Union allowed pros to reinstate , Roca and Sur did and they won two U.S. National titles .
After retiring from competitive skating , Roca and Sur toured with Stars on Ice .

Pete Seeger , collecting labor union songs , learned " Which Side Are You On " in 1940 .
The following year , it was recorded by the Almanac Singers in a version that gained a wide audience .
More recently , Billy Bragg , Dropkick Murphys , and Natalie Merchant each recorded their own interpretations of the song .
Florence Reese appeared in the Academy Award-winning documentary film , Harlan County , USA , singing her anthem to rally the striking miners .
After a lifetime of speaking out on behalf of unions and social welfare issues , Florence Reese died of a heart attack in 1986 at the age of 86 in Knoxville , Tennessee .
There are two basic ways to design the channel code and protocol for an error correcting system :
The combination is called hybrid automatic repeat-request .
In telecommunication , a redundancy check is extra data added to a message for the purposes of error detection .
Most codes are " systematic " : the transmitter sends a fixed number of original data bits , followed by fixed number of check bits ( usually referred to as redundancy in the literature ) which are derived from the data bits by some deterministic algorithm .
Main article : Parity bitA parity bit is an error detection mechanism that can only detect an odd number of errors .
If the tested blocks overlap , then the parity bits can be used to isolate the error , and even correct it if the error affects a single bit : this is the principle behind the Hamming code .
Main article : ChecksumA checksum of a message is an arithmetic sum of message code words of a certain word length , for example byte values , and their carry value .
Checksum schemes include parity bits , check digits , and longitudinal redundancy check .
If we want to detect d bit errors in an n bit word we can map every n bit word into a bigger n+d+1 bit word so that the minimum Hamming distance between each valid mapping is d+1 .
Any hash function can be used as a redundancy check .
Other types of redundancy check include horizontal redundancy check , vertical redundancy check and RAID # Non-standard_levels " double " , " dual " or " diagonal " parity ( used in Raid-DP ) .
However , at the physical layer in the OSI model , this scheme can aid in error correction and detection .
