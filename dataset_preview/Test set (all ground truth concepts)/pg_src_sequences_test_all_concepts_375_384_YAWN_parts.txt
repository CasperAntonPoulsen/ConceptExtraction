released VBN in IN the DT United NNP States NNPS . .
Once RB in IN the DT States NNPS , , he PRP paired VBD up RP with IN Renée NNP Roca NNP with IN the DT intention NN of IN skating VBG professionally RB with IN her PRP . .

Pete NNP Seeger NNP , , collecting VBG labor NN union NN songs NNS , , learned VBD " " Which JJ Side NN Are NNP You PRP On IN " " in IN 1940 CD . .
The DT following JJ year NN , , it PRP was VBD recorded VBN by IN the DT Almanac NNP Singers NNPS in IN a DT version NN that WDT gained VBD a DT wide JJ audience NN . .
More RBR recently RB , , Billy NNP Bragg NNP , , Dropkick NNP Murphys NNP , , and CC Natalie NNP Merchant NNP each DT recorded VBD their PRP$ own JJ interpretations NNS of IN the DT song NN

Florence NNP Reese NNP appeared VBD in IN the DT Academy NNP Award-winning NNP documentary NN film NN , , Harlan NNP County NNP , , USA NNP , , singing VBG her PRP$ anthem NN to TO rally VB
singing VBG her PRP$ anthem NN to TO rally VB the DT striking JJ miners NNS . .
After IN a DT lifetime NN of IN speaking VBG out RP on IN behalf NN of IN unions NNS and CC social JJ welfare NN issues NNS , , Florence NNP Reese NNP died VBD of IN a DT

There EX are VBP two CD basic JJ ways NNS to TO design VB the DT channel NN code NN and CC protocol NN for IN an DT error NN correcting VBG system NN : :
The DT combination NN is VBZ called VBN hybrid JJ automatic JJ repeat-request NN . .
In IN telecommunication NN , , a DT redundancy NN check NN is VBZ extra JJ data NNS added VBD to TO a DT message NN for IN the DT purposes NNS of IN error NN detection NN . .
Most JJS codes NNS are VBP " " systematic JJ " " : : the DT transmitter NN sends VBZ a DT fixed JJ number NN of IN original JJ data NNS bits NNS , , followed VBN by IN
data NNS bits NNS , , followed VBN by IN fixed JJ number NN of IN check NN bits NNS ( ( usually RB referred VBN to TO as IN redundancy NN in IN the DT literature NN ) ) which WDT are VBP derived VBN from IN the DT
which WDT are VBP derived VBN from IN the DT data NNS bits NNS by IN some DT deterministic JJ algorithm NN . .
Main JJ article NN : : Parity NN bitA NN parity NN bit NN is VBZ an DT error NN detection NN mechanism NN that WDT can MD only RB detect VB an DT odd JJ number NN of IN
detect VB an DT odd JJ number NN of IN errors NNS . .
If IN the DT tested JJ blocks NNS overlap VBP , , then RB the DT parity NN bits NNS can MD be VB used VBN to TO isolate VB the DT error NN , , and CC even RB
the DT error NN , , and CC even RB correct VB it PRP if IN the DT error NN affects VBZ a DT single JJ bit NN : : this DT is VBZ the DT principle NN behind IN the DT Hamming NNP code NN . .
Main JJ article NN : : ChecksumA NNP checksum NN of IN a DT message NN is VBZ an DT arithmetic JJ sum NN of IN message NN code NN words NNS of IN a DT certain JJ word NN
words NNS of IN a DT certain JJ word NN length NN , , for IN example NN byte NN values NNS , , and CC their PRP$ carry NN value NN . .
Checksum NNP schemes NNS include VBP parity NN bits NNS , , check VB digits NNS , , and CC longitudinal JJ redundancy NN check NN . .
If IN we PRP want VBP to TO detect VB d JJ bit NN errors NNS in IN an DT n JJ bit NN word NN we PRP can MD map VB every DT n JJ bit NN word NN
map VB every DT n JJ bit NN word NN into IN a DT bigger JJR n+d+1 JJ bit NN word NN so IN that IN the DT minimum JJ Hamming NNP distance NN between IN each DT valid JJ mapping NN is VBZ d+1 JJ . .
Any DT hash JJ function NN can MD be VB used VBN as IN a DT redundancy NN check NN . .
Other JJ types NNS of IN redundancy NN check NN include VBP horizontal JJ redundancy NN check NN , , vertical JJ redundancy NN check NN and CC RAID NNP # # Non-standard_levels NNP " " double JJ " "
# # Non-standard_levels NNP " " double JJ " " , , " " dual JJ " " or CC " " diagonal JJ " " parity NN ( ( used VBN in IN Raid-DP NNP ) ) . .
However RB , , at IN the DT physical JJ layer NN in IN the DT OSI NNP model NN , , this DT scheme NN can MD aid VB in IN error NN correction NN and CC detection NN
in IN error NN correction NN and CC detection NN . .
